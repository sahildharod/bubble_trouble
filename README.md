## Bubble Trouble

This is a simple bubble shooter game made in C++ which uses simplecpp to render graphics. It consists of 3 key objects the bubble, the bullet and shooter which are integrated using OOP principles. I've also added additional featuers such as progresively difficult levels, score and a timer to make the game more user friendly.
